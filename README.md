This was the group project as the part of internship at iNeuron.ai.
My team mate and my role in this perticular project was to preprocess the data, perform EDA, apply basic transformations and build the model.
Importing the data through database, cleaning the data and performing different operations related to database and deployement of model was done by other members.
